# Wrapper for Reconciling Multi-Modal Data

![GitHub Workflow Status](https://img.shields.io/github/workflow/status/Oafish1/WR2MD/Build%20and%20Test?label=tests&style=plastic)

This wrapper facilitates the use of the following techniques for reconciling multi-modal data:

- MMD-MA
- UnionCom
- ManiNetCluster (7/12 Methods)


# Notes

- MMD-MA currently only works without eager execution, meaning that programs requiring eager execution may require reimporting `tensorflow`.
